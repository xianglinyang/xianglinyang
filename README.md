### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm now a fourth-year PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore supervised by Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/).

My research focuses on robust and trustworthy machine learning techniques, emphasizing understanding, debugging, and ensuring the behavior of machine learning models. I've particularly created a visual interactive system that vividly depicts the internal evolution of deep neural networks, allowing for the inspection of ML pipelines and the identification of potential issues.

My research is always evolving, and I'm always looking for new perspectives and collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in connecting.

Please see my [homepage](https://xianglinyang.github.io/) for my recent activities!
