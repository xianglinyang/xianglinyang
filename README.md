### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm now a third year PhD candidate at National University of Singapore supervised by Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) and co-supervised by Prof. [Lin Yun](http://linyun.info/). My research interests lie in visualization and explainable AI. Please see my [homepage](https://xianglinyang.github.io/) for my recent activities!
